# Gedcom task
Your job today is to work with Genealogical Data Communication AKA. Gedcom.

This file is essentially an ansestory tree. It has information about individuals and their families.

You need to read in that file, process it and split it into either a person or a family.

## Menus
The menus will be partly done for, this is so the only thing you need to work on is the actual parsing of the file itself.

## Layout
The layout of the files is almost entirely done for you. The hashmaps, the classes are all done for you.

Your job is to just read in the file and sort them into their specific classes (person or family). So then when we use the display menus,
we can see the information on the family.

## Important information.
You **MUST** use files provided.
You **CANNOT** download code from sites and other projects. It all must be your own.
You **CAN** ask me some... questions. Also googling how to do things is ok.

Also, the file is provided in the `gedcom` directory of this project.
